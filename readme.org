#+Title: World's simplest mopidy cli

The world's simplest mopidy cli.

* Motivation

  Mopidy can be controlled with jsonRPC. I use mopidy for music. I want to
  toggle playing state and skip forward and back. For anything else there are
  real clients. But these are actions I want to bind to keypresses.

  When ~mopidy-mpd~ didn't work for me, and nor did any of the JSON-based
  mopidy scripts, I wrote this.

* Dependencies
  jq.  If you don't want to use jq, replace actual json parsing with
  ~grep paused~ .  But who doesn't want jq installed?

* Installation
  Place in your path.

* Usage
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
mopidy_cli.sh playpause
mopidy_cli.sh next # or prev
  #+END_SRC
